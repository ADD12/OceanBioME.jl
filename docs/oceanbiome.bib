   abstract = {PISCES-v2 (Pelagic Interactions Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies volume 2) is a biogeochemical model which simulates the lower trophic levels of marine ecosystems (phytoplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and of the main nutrients (P, N, Fe, and Si). The model is intended to be used for both regional and global configurations at high or low spatial resolutions as well as for short-term (seasonal, interannual) and long-term (climate change, paleoceanography) analyses. There are 24 prognostic variables (tracers) including two phytoplankton compartments (diatoms and nanophytoplankton), two zooplankton size classes (microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and a description of the carbonate chemistry. Formulations in PISCES-v2 are based on a mixed Monod-quota formalism. On the one hand, stoichiometry of C / N / P is fixed and growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the external availability in N, P and Si. On the other hand, the iron and silicon quotas are variable and the growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the internal availability in Fe. Various parameterizations can be activated in PISCES-v2, setting, for instance, the complexity of iron chemistry or the description of particulate organic materials. So far, PISCES-v2 has been coupled to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) systems. A full description of PISCES-v2 and of its optional functionalities is provided here. The results of a quasi-steady-state simulation are presented and evaluated against diverse observational and satellite-derived data. Finally, some of the new functionalities of PISCES-v2 are tested in a series of sensitivity experiments.},

In addition to wet and dry weights, the model simulates carbon and nitrogen reserves, with variable C/N ratio. In effect, the model can be used to emulate seasonal changes in growth and composition of the alga. Simulation results based on published, environmental field data are presented and compared with corresponding data on growth and composition. The model resolves seasonal growth, carbon and nitrogen content well, and may contribute to the understanding of how seasonal growth in S. latissima depends simultaneously on a combination of several environmental factors: light, nutrients, temperature and water motion.

A previously developed model for the frond size and composition (carbon and nitrogen content) of S. latissima sporophytes was adjusted to data from an outdoor mesocosm growth experiment and then coupled and run online with the 3-dimensional model system. Results from simulations were compared with data from an IMTA field experiment, providing partial validation of the hydrodynamic-ecological-kelp model system. The model system was applied to study the large-scale cultivation potential of S. latissima in IMTA with salmon and to quantify its seasonal bioremediation potential. The results suggest a possible yield of 75 t fresh weight S. latissima ha-1 in 4 mo (February to June) and about 170 t fresh weight ha-1 in 10 mo (August to June). The results further suggest that the net nitrogen consumption of a 1 ha S. latissima installation in the vicinity of a fish farm producing approximately 5000 t salmon in a production cycle is about 0.36 (0.15) t NH4+-N, or a removal of 0.34% (0.41%) of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen effluent with a cultivation period from August (February) to June. Due to the differing seasonal growth patterns of fish and kelp, there was a mismatch between the maximum effluent of NH4+-N from the fish farm and the maximum uptake rates in S. latissima.},

The results are spatially explicit and may be used to compare the suitability of different regions for kelp cultivation, both inshore and offshore.The simulation results were compared with growth data from kelp cultivation experiments and in situ observations on coverage of naturally growing kelp. The model demonstrated a higher production potential offshore than in inshore regions, which is mainly due to the limitations in nutrient availability caused by the stratification found along the coast. However, suitable locations for kelp cultivation were also identified in areas with high vertical mixing close to the shore. The results indicate a latitudinal effect on the timing of the optimal period of growth, with the prime growth period being up to 2 months earlier in the south (58 °N) than in the north (71 °N). Although the maximum cultivation potential was similar in the six marine ecoregions in Norway (150-200 tons per hectare per year), the deployment time of the cultures seems to matter significantly in the south, but less so in the north. The results are discussed, focusing on their potential significance for optimized cultivation and to support decision making toward sustainable management.},

Data collected during the first survey were used for model initialization, and data from three other cruises were used for model validation. The model successfully predicts the time evolution of the main reservoirs and fluxes, except for a storm event during postbloom conditions, for which the biological impact is underestimated. The bloom is long in duration (2 months), has low intensity (1 mg Chl m-3), and is characterized by a small f-ratio (0.45) and a small e-ratio (0.05). Furthermore, the model reveals much stronger space and time variability than sampled in the data. This large variability results both from the synoptic atmospheric variability and from the stirring induced by oceanic mesoscale eddies. In particular, the bloom starts in specific submesoscale features that correspond to filaments of minimum mixed layer depth. On short timescales (2-3 days), space and time variability have the same order of magnitude. On the seasonal timescale, time variability is larger than space variability. Considering the transient state of the system, this modeling exercise is also used to quantify the nonsynopticity of the observations, which occur mostly during bloom conditions, a crucial point for the data interpretation.

Chlorophyll-like pigment concentration is used as the index to quantify the algal material (living and detrital), and statistical relationships between this index and the depth of the euphotic layer, the spectral values of the attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, or the scattering coefficient are investigated. On the basis of these statistical relationships a pigment-dependent optical model is developed. It allows the propagation of the visible radiant energy within the ocean or the backscattered radiation from the upper layer to be predicted as a function of the local phytoplanktonic content. Other geophysical or geochemical applications are derived which concern the heating rate due to penetrating visible radiations or the rate of energy storage due to photosynthesis. The nonlinear trends observed in the algal biomass-attenuation relationships are analyzed by (1) considering the rather regular change of the living-to-detrital organic carbon ratio which seems to occur in oceanic waters ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and (2) accounting for the respective contributions of absorption (by pigmented cells) and of scattering (by all kind of particulates) in the attenuation process of radiant energy.},

   abstract = {A high-resolution ocean biogeochemical model is used to estimate oceanic pCO2 and air-sea CO2 flux in the NE Atlantic. The model is validated against shipboard and Carioca drifting float data acquired during the POMME experiment. Between winter and spring, the seasonal variability is characterized by a rapid drawdown of pCO2 of ∼20 μatm associated with the phytoplankton bloom driving CO2 uptake by the ocean. The model reveals that this uptake propagates northward in response to the northward propagation of the bloom. More remarkably, this study demonstrates intense variability of the carbon system at the submesoscale. Our model predicts filamentary structures of pCO2 that show gradients of 25 μatm over 20 km, consistent with observations from Carioca drifting floats. This submesoscale variability is similar in magnitude to the mean seasonal drawdown. Lagrangian diagnostics suggest that pCO2 small-scale structures are shaped by horizontal stirring of large-scale gradients created by the bloom northward propagation. We compared air-sea flux derived from model pCO2 and from observed pCO2 and estimated the error due to data undersampling to ∼15 to 30%. Results from a simulation at coarser resolution showed that the impact of model resolution on air-sea CO2 flux is only ∼5%. This suggests that the submesoscale variability of pCO2, although large in amplitude, accounts for small modulation of the net air-sea CO2 flux in this region.

We have reviewed the approaches to couple benthic and pelagic biogeochemical models. It is concluded that they can be classified into a hierarchical set consisting of five levels, differing in the amount of detail given to the sediment processes. Ž. The most complex approach level 4 fully couples water column processes to a vertically resolved biogeochemical sediment Ž. model. First simplification is achieved by using a vertically integrated dynamic sediment model level 3 ; next is a reflective Ž. type of boundary level 2 where particulate material arriving at the sediment surface is instantaneously transformed into dissolved components. Then comes a set of models in which either the bottom-water concentration of dissolved substances Ž. or the sediment-water exchange is imposed level 1. Finally, in some biogeochemical models, the bottom is plainly ignored Ž. level 0. We have tested these various approaches in a coupled physical-pelagic-benthic biogeochemical model for oxygen, nitrogen and carbon cycling in continental shelf areas. We discuss the various model approaches with respect to their impact on the pelagic system and point out some of the inconsistencies hidden in certain formulations. We conclude that lower Ž. boundary types, in which sediment fluxes or concentrations are imposed level 1 , are especially badly designed because they fail to assure conservation of mass. Finally, we suggest as best choice a level 3 approach in which the evolution of sedimentary particulate matter is part of the solution and where the bottom fluxes of dissolved constituents are parameterised based on mass budget considerations. These simplified formulations represent the best balance between computational demand and attained accuracy. q},

   abstract = {The kinetics of particulate organic carbon (POC) mineralization in marine surface sediments is not well constrained. This creates considerable uncertainties when benthic processes are considered in global biogeochemical or Earth system circulation models to simulate climate-ocean interactions and biogeochemical tracer distributions in the ocean. In an attempt to improve our understanding of the rate and depth distribution of organic carbon mineralization in bioturbated (0-20cm) sediments at the global scale, we parameterized a 1-D diagenetic model that simulates the mineralization of three discrete POC pools (a "multi-G" model). The rate constants of the three reactive classes (highly reactive, reactive, refractory) are fixed and determined to be 70, 0.5 and ∼ 0.001yr-1, respectively, based on the Martin curve model for pelagic POC degradation. In contrast to previous approaches, however, the reactivity of the organic material degraded in the seafloor is continuous with, and set by, the apparent reactivity of material sinking through the water column. Despite the simplifications of describing POC remineralization using G-type approaches, the model is able to simulate a global database (185 stations) of benthic oxygen and nitrate fluxes across the sediment-water interface in addition to porewater oxygen and nitrate distributions and organic carbon burial efficiencies. It is further consistent with degradation experiments using fresh phytoplankton reported in a previous study. We propose that an important yet mostly overlooked consideration in upscaling approaches is the proportion of the reactive POC classes reaching the seafloor in addition to their reactivity. The approach presented is applicable to both steady-state and non-steady state scenarios, and links POC degradation kinetics in sedimentary environments to water depth and the POC rain rate to the seafloor.},

Most macroalgae naturally grow in shallow coastal waters, and their ability to grow in open ocean conditions is largely untested. Here we quantify macroalgae growth potential in the North Atlantic using an established model of Saccharina latissima forced by an ocean state estimate. In the relatively clear open ocean waters, we find that growth is possible to depths of up to 50 m across most of the region, with the maximum depth-integrated growth potential between 40 and 50°N. The model exhibits a large carbon to nitrogen ratio at the southern end of the growth range. The ratio of kelp carbon to phytoplankton biomass is also relatively high in the southeastern portion of the growth range. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that the position of the southern limit of the growth range is largely modulated by temperature tolerance on the western side of the basin in the Gulf Stream and low nitrate on the eastern side of the basin. We also find a statistically significant reduction in the kelp growth potential over the period from 2002 to 2019, reflecting the warming of the surface ocean over this period.},

   abstract = {Sediment biogeochemical processes impact pelagic ecosystems when the sediment receives particulate organic matter (POM) deposited from the water column above, consumes dissolved oxygen, and returns inorganic nutrients to the bottom water. However, an easy-to-apply sediment model is still lacking for pelagic biogeochemical modeling. In this study, we proposed a mass conservative, process-based and easy-to-apply sediment flux model (SFM) that endeavors to simplify Di Toro (2001)’s sediment flux model (DSFM) while maintaining the ability to model sediment fluxes in multiple environments (e.g., anoxic, normoxic, variable salinity, high and low organic matter deposition, etc.). It adopts a vertically integrated approach, and has a relatively simple structure with limited number of parameters. The mineralization scheme for POM is based on bacterial growth, which can resolve the diagenesis processes on different timescales. The inhibition effects of oxygen on denitrification of NO3 and desorption of PO4 are modeled using exponential functions. This new SFM is then implemented in the Chesapeake Bay to simulate sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and sediment NH4/NO3/PO4/Silica fluxes across the sediment–water interface. To estimate POM depositional fluxes from the water column, a new method is introduced that links surficial sediment and bottom-water POM concentrations. Further integration of this method into the SFM turns the model calibration into a mass conservative and self-consistent process, which is well constrained by observations. The modeled sediment fluxes from the new SFM match observations across seasons and stations with correlation coefficient ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. The successful application of SFM in Chesapeake Bay and subsequent analysis show that the new SFM has many advantages including mass conservation, high temporal resolution, relatively simple structure, and easy implementation. The SFM is a good tool for linking pelagic ecosystem models to sediment biogeochemical processes.},

   abstract = {Using a protocol of numerical experiments where horizontal resolution is progressively increased, we show that small-scale (or sub-mesoscale) physics has a strong impact on both mesoscale physics and phytoplankton production/subduction. Mesoscale and sub-mesoscale physics result from the nonlinear equilibration of an unstable baroclinic jet. The biogeochemicalcontext is oligotrophy. The explicitly resolved sub-mesoscales,at least smaller than one fth of the internal Rossby radius of deformation, reinforce the mesoscale eddy eld and contribute to double the primary production and phytoplankton subduction budgets. This enhancement is due to the reinforced mesoscale physics and is also achieved by the small-scale frontal dynamics. This sub-mesoscale physics is associated with density and vorticity gradients around and between the eddies. It triggers a signii cant small-scale nutrient injection in the surface layers, leading to a phytoplankton eld mostly dominated by ne spatial structures. It is believed that, depending on wind forcings, this scenario should work alternately with that of Abraham (1998) which invokes horizontal stirring of nutrient injected at large scales. Results also reveal a strong relationship between new production and negative vorticity, in the absence of wind forcing and during the period of formation of the eddies.},

   abstract = {In this study we first evaluate the small-scale spatial variability of particulate export, using a set of synoptic thorium-234 activity observations sampled within a one-degree radius. These data show significant variability of surface thorium activity on scales of the order of 100km (~270-550dpmm -3). This patchiness of export potentially affects the robustness of point observations and our interpretation of them. Motivated by these observations we subsequently couple an explicit model of thorium-234 dynamics to a coupled physical-biogeochemical basin model capable of resolving these small-scales. The model supports the observations in displaying marked thorium variability on spatial scales of the order of 100km and smaller, with highest values in the regions of large eddy kinetic energy and large primary productivity. The model is also used to quantify the impact of small-scale variability on export estimates. Our model shows that the primary source of error associated with the presence of small-scale spatial variability is related to the standard assumptions of steady state and non-steady state (>40% during bloom condition). The non-steady state method can misinterpret variations due to patchiness in thorium activity as temporal changes and lead to errors larger than those introduced by the simpler steady state approach. We show that the non-steady state approach could improve the flux estimates in some cases if the sampling was conducted in a Lagrangian framework. Undersampling the spatial variability results in further bias (>20%) that can be reduced when the sampling density is increased. Finally, errors due to the dynamical transport of thorium associated with small-scale structures are relatively low (<20%) except in regions of high eddy kinetic energy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Northeast Atlantic mode waters (NEAMW) are formed by subduction in a region known to be a strong sink of atmospheric CO2. This study investigates the biological and physical carbon pumps involved in this sink. For that purpose, we estimate the annual transfer of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen from the surface into the ocean interior through NEAMW subduction. Our estimates are based on a model simulation constrained with data collected during the Programme Océan Multidisciplinaire Méso Echelle (POMME). We found that subduction accounts for a large proportion of carbon export below the mixed layer in the POMME region (38°N-45°N, 16°W-22°W). Fifty percent of labile organic carbon is exported by the biological pump and 50% by subduction; 98% of the total carbon flux below the mixed layer is due to carbon subduction, essentially in the form of dissolved inorganic carbon and of more refractory dissolved organic matter. This is because they are the dominant pools of carbon and are passing through the winter mixed-layer depth gradient that characterizes the region. Our results emphasize that the net export of carbon represents a small fraction of the fluxes of carbon across the mixed layer through the processes of subduction and obduction. Moreover, our results indicate that NEAMW subduction occurs before the spring bloom. This implies that NEAMW is mostly subducted with end-winter characteristics with, in particular, relatively high nutrient content. This reflects a relative inefficiency in nutrient utilization and contrasts with subtropical mode waters, which are subducted during the bloom and are thus relatively poor in nutrients when they are subducted.

The aim of this study was to investigate the growth and composition of the kelp Saccharina latissima in salmon-driven IMTA, and to assess the spatial extent of the influence of salmon derived nitrogen in order to evaluate the upscaling potential for IMTA. S. latissima was cultivated 100, 200, and 1,000 m east and 1,000 m west of a 5,000 tons salmon farm in Western Norway from February to September 2013. The proportion of salmon derived nitrogen available for the kelp showed a clear decline with distance from the farm. Accordingly, the kelp cultivated near the salmon cages grew faster during the spring season, and growth rate decreased with increasing distance from the farm. A spatially explicit numerical model system (SINMOD), including compartments for dissolved nutrients and kelp growth, was tuned to the field data and used to investigate the potential for upscaling IMTA production. The model was used to introduce a new metric-the impacted area IA-for the areal effects of IMTA in terms of the increase in production by IMTA. The model showed that a 25 hectare kelp farm in the vicinity of the studied salmon farm could take up 1.6 of the 13.5 tons of dissolved inorganic nitrogen released during kelp cultivation, amounting to almost 12% of the ammonia released during the cultivation period from February to June. The 25 hectare kelp farm would have a production yield of 1,125 tons fresh weight (FW), being 60% more than that of a non-IMTA kelp farm, while a 20% increase of kelp FW could be obtained over a 110 hectar area in salmon-driven IMTA. To achieve an even mass balance, an area of approximately 220 ha-1 would be needed to cultivate enough kelp to fix an equivalent of the nitrogen released by the fish.},

   abstract = {Sediments are the main repository in the oceanic cycles of carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). In order to relate the deposition of organic C and organic P from the water column, and ultimate burial in sediments, we present a model for the early diagenesis of organic matter in marine sediments. This general diagenetic model was developed for inclusion in global circulation models and is based on a single master variable, the sedimentation rate. The processes included are sediment advection, particle mixing by bio-turbation, porewater diffusion, organic matter degradation by aerobic respiration, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis. Deposition fluxes of organic C and organic P, and the bottomwater concentrations of 02 and SO~ are used as input for the sediment model. First-order kinetics are assumed for the degradation of organic C and organic P (one-G model). Despite the model's simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces the rates of organic matter oxidation and the burial fluxes of organic C and P. The predicted trends of oxygen penetration depth and the relative importance of oxygen and sulfate reduction are in good agreement with field observations. The model appears to account for the critical biogeochemical and transport processes that control the fate of organic matter in sediments.},

@article{KUHN2015176,
	abstract = {The spring bloom -- a massive growth of phytoplankton that occurs annually during the spring season in mid and high latitudes -- plays an important role in carbon export to the deep ocean. The onset of this event has been explained from bottom-up and top-down perspectives, exemplified by the ``critical-depth'' and the ``dilution-recoupling'' hypotheses, respectively. Both approaches differ in their key expectations about how seasonal fluctuations of the mixed layer affect the plankton community. Here we assess whether the assumptions inherent to these hypotheses are met inside a typical onedimensional Nutrient--Phytoplankton--Zooplankton--Detritus (NPZD) model, optimized to best represent climatological annual cycles of satellite-based phytoplankton biomass in the Subpolar North Atlantic. The optimized model is used in idealized experiments that isolate the effects of mixed layer fluctuations and zooplankton grazing, in order to elucidate their significance. We analyzed the model sensitivity qualitatively and using a second-order Taylor series decomposition of the model equations. Our results show that the conceptual bases of both bottom-up and top-down approaches are required to explain the process of blooming; however, neither of their bloom initiation mechanisms fully applies in the experiments. We find that a spring bloom can develop in the absence of mixed layer fluctuations, and both its magnitude and timing seem to strongly depend on nutrient and light availability. Furthermore, although zooplankton populations modulate the phytoplankton concentrations throughout the year, directly prescribed and physically driven changes in zooplankton grazing do not produce significant time shifts in bloom initiation, as hypothesized. While recognizing its limitations, our study emphasizes the processes that require further testing in order to discern among competing hypotheses.},

@article{taylor2016,
	abstract = {Abstract High-resolution large-eddy simulations are used to study the influence of submesoscale mixed layer instability and small-scale turbulence on phytoplankton growth in light-limited conditions. Four simulations are considered with small-scale turbulence driven by varying levels of surface cooling. Significant small-scale turbulence is seen even without surface forcing, and the downward mixing of phytoplankton is sufficient to briefly delay the developing bloom. Moderate and strong values of the constant surface heat flux (Q =− 10,−100 W/m2) are sufficient to prevent a bloom. In contrast to the critical depth hypothesis, the growth rate for phytoplankton does not appear to be controlled by the mixed layer depth. Instead, a comparison between the turbulent diffusivity above the compensation depth and a critical value predicted by the critical turbulence hypothesis closely matches the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton growth.},
