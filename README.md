### Ocean Biogeochemial Modelling Environment

## Description
OceanBioME was developed with generous support from the Cambridge Centre for Climate Repair [CCRC](https://www.climaterepair.cam.ac.uk) and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation as a tool to study the effectiveness and impacts of ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies.

OceanBioME is a flexible modelling environment written in Julia for modelling the coupled interactions between ocean biogeochemistry, carbonate chemistry, and physics. OceanBioME can be run as a stand-alone box model, or coupled with Oceananigans.jl to run as a 1D column model or with 3D physics. 

## Installation (before release):

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/OceanBioME/OceanBioME.jl")
```
